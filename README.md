### Description
Welcome to Polyland. This polygon city has it all - A nice park, a Bowling alley, a Guitar shop, even a Church. But the most interesting building is the great bank located at its heart.

As a notorious challenge seeking robber, your mission is to sneak into the bank, crack the safe open and escape without getting caught. It will not be easy!
Even if you don’t like solving riddles we’re sure your minds will be blown by the amazing soundtrack and interactive interface.
